# LLS Editing Project

The goal of the project is to edit the LLS (first 500 chapters) into something more readable.

Feel free to clone the repo, open tickets and submit merge requests.

Ground Rules
===========

1. No big changes in formatting. The text is presented as very simple HTML, with one line per paragraph. Based on my editing experience, that is a very good practice.

2. All changes are subject to review. Changes could be rejected if they deviate too far from the original translation, or are too large. To facilitate the review process, try to focus your edits only on certain aspects or chapter sets, and submit them often.

3. You do not own the changes. Such is the thankless job of the book editors: all rights belong to owners of the original work (Qidian) and the derivative work (translation to English by Shiroyukineko et al). I'll keep the list of the contributors, but do not expect anything more. I myself do not.

Initial Goals (Small)
=============

1. Fix long-standing issues through the book (e.g. the ranaming of the "Mercenary Guild", "Sky Demon Palace", etc).

2. Fix inconsistent person names throughout the book (Zhi Wei vs Zi Wei and such).

3. Fix inconsistent rank names (Saint/Holy/Divine/Godly and so on).

Long-term Goals (Big)
===============

1. Improve language. Some sentences make no sense. Many verbs are in wrong tense. Many words have wrong plurality.

2. Remove non-English words. ("unloyal" is poor English, "enamourment" is even worse.)

3. Redo the battles, as their translation and editing is by far the worst. ("Sleeping Hui Tai Lang [...] on the back of the enemy"?)
