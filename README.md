# LLS Editing Project

Not affiliaed with publishers or translator groups.

Just a LLS fan - doing it for himself and other LLS fans.

The goal of the project is to edit the LLS (first 500 chapters) into something more readable.

Feel free to open issues, or directly clone repo and submit merge requests.

How LLS fans can help
========================

If you read the LLS (first 500 chapters) and spot a problem, you can report it here as an "issue". For that you would need a GitHub account.

Read LLS [here](http://shiroyukitranslations.com/long-live-summons/). Donate to help the translators!

Upvote LLS on [Baka](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=123346) or [NovelUpdates](http://www.novelupdates.com/series/long-live-summons/)


Initial Goals (Small)
=============

1. Fix long-standing issues through the book (e.g. the ranaming of the "Mercenary Guild", "Sky Demon Palace", etc).

2. Fix inconsistent person names throughout the book (Zhi Wei vs Zi Wei and such).

3. Fix inconsistent rank names (Saint/Holy/Divine/Godly and so on).

Long-term Goals (Big)
===============

1. Improve language. Some sentences make no sense. Many verbs are in wrong tense. Many words have wrong plurality.

2. Remove non-English words. ("unloyal" is poor English, "enamourment" is even worse.)

3. Redo the battles, as their translation and editing is by far the worst. ("Sleeping Hui Tai Lang [...] on the back of the enemy"?)

Nice to have
